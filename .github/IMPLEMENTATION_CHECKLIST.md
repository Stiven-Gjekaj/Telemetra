## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Workflow file not found
**Solution**: Verify file path is exactly `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Issue: Syntax error in workflow
**Solution**: Use GitHub's workflow editor for validation

### Issue: Services fail to start
**Solution**: Check Docker logs, verify Docker Compose file, check system resources

### Issue: Health check timeout
**Solution**: Increase retry count or delay, check service logs

### Issue: Tests fail on first run
**Solution**: Review test fixtures, check database initialization

### Issue: Artifacts not uploaded
**Solution**: Verify artifact paths exist, check retention policy

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First Week
- [ ] Monitor workflow runs daily
- [ ] Review any failures
- [ ] Check execution times
- [ ] Verify artifact collection
- [ ] Monitor resource usage

### First Month
- [ ] Analyze workflow performance

- [ ] Update documentation as needed

### Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] Weekly: Review failed runs
- [ ] Monthly: Update dependencies
- [ ] Quarterly: Review and optimize workflow
- [ ] As needed: Add new tests, fix issues
